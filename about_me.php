                <h1>About Me</h1>
                Hey guys! My name is Tim. I go to Woolbury Elementary School. I'm in the 5th grade! I really like
                dinosaurs and monster trucks. My Favorite food is pizza! I really like going to the mall and playing
                video games. My favorite video game is Mario. He can jump really high and he can shoot fire
                sometimes. Last year my family went to florida for vacation and I got to pet an alligator. When my
                dad gets home from his trip he said he will buy me an alligator for my birthday.
