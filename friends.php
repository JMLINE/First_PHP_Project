                <p>My best friend is Tanner because with both like dinos. Shawn used to be my best friend, but he said
                    he didn't like power rangers, so I said he couldn't be my best friend anymore. My fourth best friend
                    is Sammy because he sometimes shares his animal crackers with me at lunch time. My seventh best
                    friend is Jacob. He is really good at basketball. My eleventh best friend is Jeremy. He used to be
                    my fifth best friend, but he said I liked Becky and I do not!</p>
