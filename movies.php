        <h1>My favorite movies</h1>
        <p>I really like the indian in the cupboard. That is probably my second favorite movie. My first
            favorite movie is Power Rangers. I really like how they can turn into robots. They are the good
            guys! Last weekend my mom took me to see a movie named Seven. It was sooo weird! I didn't know what
            that was about. But the popcorn was really good. My mom said if I keep eating popcorn I would
            explode! But I'm ok. I really like milk duds too. But they get stuck in my teeth sometimes.</p>
